\textbf{RE: Sponsorship Request for ``Harmony Across Generations'' --- A Musical Journey Through Korean Heritage}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\noindent
Dear Bank of Hope Leadership,

\ \\
I am writing to request sponsorship support for a special community event that has touched the hearts of over Korean (and non-Korean) 400 family members in the Bay Area community.

\subsection*{About the Event:}

On October 4, 2025, we are hosting ``Harmony Across Generations'' at \href{https://maps.app.goo.gl/W3qRPoNthuNzsjG5A}{Stanford University's EVGR Theater}, featuring internationally acclaimed conductor Maestro Yoonhak Baek. This pre-Chuseok celebration brings together families through music, bridging generations and celebrating Korean cultural heritage.

\noindent
What began as a modest gathering for 20 people became something far more powerful. When we opened registration, over 400 family members responded---sharing deeply personal stories about why this event matters to them.

\subsection*{The Stories That Moved Us:}

Among the hundreds of submissions, we received stories from:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item A mother whose son with autism found his voice through classical music, attending SF Symphony as his favorite activity, and who desperately wanted to meet Maestro Baek
\item Families celebrating their first Chuseok in America, seeking connection to their heritage
\item A family reunited after three years of separation due to immigration delays, wanting to mark their anniversary together through music
\item Engineers and scientists who saw themselves in Maestro Baek's journey from Seoul Science High School mathematics to musical artistry
\item Grandparents, parents, and children spanning three generations, all seeking to share the melodies that connect their past and future
\item Parents who once sang in Korean choirs now passing that love to their American-born children
\item Individuals who've used music as healing, as identity, as the universal language that transcends all boundaries
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why This Matters:}

Through this process, I've learned something profound.
As the \href{https://k-privateai.github.io/}{Silicon Valley Privacy-Preserving AI From (K-PAI)} leader,
I've organized many professional forums in Silicon Valley, but this experience was different.
The overwhelming response revealed something our community deeply needs: spaces where music and cultural heritage bring families together across generations.

These stories reminded us that music holds a power that even Silicon Valley's cutting-edge AI technology cannot match---the power to heal, to connect, and to preserve what makes us human.

\subsection*{A Personal Note:}

Preparing this event reconnected me with Maestro Baek, my friend since we met back at Seoul Science High School in 1991. Hosting him and planning this gathering reminded me of what truly matters---not just professional success, but the music, memories, and human connections that give life meaning.

\ \\
Bank of Hope's support would make this special moment possible for 100 family members carrying similar dreams.
Thank you for considering this request. We would be deeply honored to have Bank of Hope as our partner in creating this meaningful celebration of music, heritage, and community.
