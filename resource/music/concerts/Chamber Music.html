<strong>Work Composed:</strong> 2018</small></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./Chamber Music_files/headshots2024-25-azmehk.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="300" height="371"></figure><p>Following initial studies on the violin, Kinan Azmeh switched to clarinet at the age of six. After graduating from the Damascus High Institute of Music and Damascus University’s School of Electrical Engineering, he proceeded to study clarinet at the Juilliard School, where he received his master’s degree and graduate diploma. Azmeh is now based in New York, where in 2013 he earned his PhD at the City University of New York.</p><p>He was the first Arab musician to win the Nikolai Rubinstein International Youth Competition in Moscow. In 2003, he and four Syrian colleagues formed the Arabic jazz band Hewar, which he describes as “an attempt to transcend the barriers of cultural disparities and misconceptions, and establish a civilized communication which builds on what brings humans closer together.” He is also a member of the Silk Road Ensemble and has appeared with Daniel Barenboim’s West-Eastern Divan Orchestra.</p><p>Azmeh has produced a substantial body of compositions in many genres, including solo and chamber pieces, orchestral works, film scores, and music for theater and dance. <em>Café Damas</em>, for violin, cello, and double bass, was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and premiered by three of its musicians in January 2019. Azmeh provided this comment about the piece:</p><blockquote>This work is inspired by the idea of an imaginary traditional house band in a 1960s café in Damascus, a band that has not changed personnel nor location for decades and continues to play in spite of all. Musically speaking, this piece enjoys a rather traditional form that opens with a taqasīm (melodic improvisation), which introduces the listener to the maqam (mode) of the composition, followed by a variety of fast modal and rhythmic transformations and solos. Finally, there is a coda that brings back a distant and faded memory of the same imaginary band in that imaginary Damascus café.</blockquote><h2 id="quintet-in-e-flat-major-k452">Quintet in E-flat major, K.452</h2><h3 id="wolfgang-amadeus-mozart-1">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</h3><p><small><strong>Born:</strong> January 27, 1756, in Salzburg<br>
<strong>Died:</strong> December 5, 1791, in Vienna<br>
<strong>Work Composed:</strong> 1784</small></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./Chamber Music_files/headshots2024-25-mozartwa.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="300" height="371"></figure><p>On April 10, 1784, Mozart wrote from his home in Vienna to his father in Salzburg to relay news about his recent triumphs. “The concert I gave in the theater,” he reported, “was most successful. I composed two grand concertos and then a quintet, which called forth the very greatest applause; I myself consider it the best thing I have ever written in my life. It is written for one oboe, one clarinet, one horn, one bassoon, and the pianoforte. How I wish you could have heard it! And how beautifully it was performed! Well, to tell the truth, I was really worn out by the end after playing so much—and it is greatly to my credit that the audience did not in any degree share the fatigue.”</p><p>That’s strong praise, indeed—even making allowances for the generosity of self-congratulation. The performance took place on April 1 at the Burgtheater, and it was liberally packed with music, in line with the custom of the day. Symphonies opened and closed the proceedings (most likely a single symphony split in two), surrounding a succession of arias, a keyboard improvisation, two piano concertos, and this quintet. Mozart had signed off on the piece on March 30, which doubtless caused considerable anxiety among the wind players who were scheduled to unveil it only two days later—the more so since the work’s instrumentation was apparently unprecedented. Nonetheless, all parties must have acquitted themselves with distinction to earn the ovation Mozart described.</p><p>The piece seems as much descended from the piano concerto as from chamber music. Piano concertos were much on Mozart’s mind, as he wrote four of them around the same time. In those, he sometimes called for woodwinds to interact with the solo piano almost like equal partners. The quintet’s piano part is quite brilliant, much like what one would expect to find in a concerto, and the piano gets the honor of introducing most of the themes as they appear. The instrument’s prominence seems logical, given its broad range and harmonic capabilities compared to the woodwinds; and it’s worth recalling that Mozart was writing for his own use—and he was never inclined to hide his light under a bushel. On the other hand, the quintet <em>is</em> chamber music at heart, and the four woodwinds are kept plenty busy throughout, even if their parts don’t quite rival the piano’s in sheer virtuosity.</p><h2 id="sonatine-en-trio-opus-85">Sonatine en trio, Opus 85</h2><h3 id="florent-schmitt-1">Florent Schmitt</h3><p><small><strong>Born:</strong> September 28, 1870, in Blâmont, France<br>
<strong>Died:</strong> August 17, 1958, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France<br>
<strong>Work Composed:</strong> 1934–35</small></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./Chamber Music_files/headshots2024-25-schmittf.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="300" height="371"></figure><p>Florent Schmitt’s compositions cover an exceptionally broad range of musical approaches, attitudes, and aspirations. “A leading feature of his work is a strength which sometimes produces violence and even brutality,” reads his entry in <em>Cobbett’s Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music</em> (1929). “On the other hand, the gentler side is not lacking; he can paint tenderness, sorrow, and despair.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Above all, he follows no set methods of composition; it is no exaggeration to say that he has a horror of all attempts to fashion ideas according to rule.”</p><p>Schmitt was born in Lorraine, in the border region where France abuts Germany, and his music-loving parents fed him a diet of German classics. Nonetheless, he went to school at the Paris Conservatory, where his composition professors included Jules Massenet and Gabriel Fauré. Although he was not a standout pupil, he eventually managed to win the Prix de Rome, a useful stamp of approval for any aspiring French composer.</p><p>Some of his pieces were considered bravely avant-garde, and they evoked powerful responses pro and contra, but on the whole he was widely esteemed among French composers. When Paul Dukas died in 1935 and his seat at the Institut de France opened up, Schmitt and Igor Stravinsky were nominated to succeed him. Schmitt beat Stravinsky, 28 votes to 4. His music was slow to penetrate the export market, although critics cheered a number of his scores during an American tour in 1932–33, hailing his Piano Quintet as one of the most impressive of modern chamber pieces.</p><p>He was a busy music critic himself, one who expressed himself in writing with the same bluntness he did in conversation. Not everyone appreciated his habit of shouting out his opinions in real time as pieces unrolled at concerts. He was also a virulent antisemite who nurtured a cozy relationship with the Vichy regime during World War II. This could infect his concert outbursts, some of which were so jaw-droppingly offensive that they merit absolute oblivion.</p><p>He wrote the Sonatine en trio in 1934–35 for flute, clarinet, and harpsichord (with piano as an accepted substitute), and the following year he prepared a version for violin, cello, and piano. He composed it expressly for the Italian harpsichordist Corradina Mola, an early-music pioneer. She played in its premiere on January 29, 1936, in Paris, and penned a long, flowery description of the four short movements. In the first, the god Pan basks in a clearing beneath dappled light and is joined by gamboling fauns. In the second, Pan is in the woods, hearing the water of a stream ripple over the stones. In the third, a dense forest leads to a dismal pond. And in the fourth, Pan returns to the edge of the forest, where he is bathed in light. “With all his soul, he exhales his joy, his unspeakable new-found bliss.”</p><h2 id="piano-quartet-in-e-flat-major-opus-47">Piano Quartet in E-flat&nbsp;major, Opus 47</h2><h3 id="robert-schumann-1">Robert Schumann</h3><p><small><strong>Born:</strong> June 8, 1810, in&nbsp;Zwickau, Saxony<br>
<strong>Died:</strong> July 29, 1856, Endenich, near Bonn<br>
<strong>Work Composed:</strong> 1842</small></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./Chamber Music_files/headshots2024-25-schumannr.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="300" height="371"></figure><p>Robert Schumann and his music are so full of surprises that it seems unfair to codify his life and achievements in terms of rehashed truisms. And yet he did characterize his musical personality as the duality of his sub-egos, the fiery Florestan and the dreamy Eusebius, and his music’s emotions can often be broadly reduced to those extremes. And it is also true that Schumann dedicated himself almost exclusively to specific genres for extended periods, exploring their many facets before moving on to mine other lodes. Chamber music occupied him from 1842 until 1847, during which time he produced several works that combined his earlier achievements in piano writing with new discoveries about the art of the string ensemble. From this impetus grew two of chamber music’s greatest masterpieces: his Piano Quintet and Piano Quartet, both written in 1842.</p><p>The Piano Quartet begins with a hushed opening of rich chords that shortly give way to a well-measured Allegro and the first broad melody, which is introduced by cello. This is probably not incidental: the work was commissioned by Count Mathieu (or Matvei) Wielhorsky, an accomplished amateur cellist and concert impresario in Saint Petersburg. A Scherzo follows. Though marked Molto vivace, it is hardly buoyant in a Mendelssohn way; a slightly sinister undercurrent emerges here and there throughout the Scherzo proper and its two contrasting trio sections. In the third movement, the cello again emerges to sing one of Schumann’s most sublime melodies, perfect in its balance, soulfulness, and apparent simplicity. The melody is handed off in turn to the violin and then the piano, which applies elegant embellishment. A central section seems almost prayerful and chorale-like, profoundly comforting. The original song melody returns, this time with violin filigree; and at the very end the cellist surreptitiously tunes their lowest string down a step to the otherwise-inaccessible low B-flat, providing a 13-bar pedal-point support for the suspended animation of the movement’s coda. “Alas!,” wrote the Schumann biographer Robert Haven Schauffler 80 years ago, “the long solo which opens the movement, too saccharine in feeling and too mechanical in construction, is the weakest part of the work.” Surely most music-lovers would disagree, and in the strongest terms.</p><p>The Eusebius of the Andante cantabile is replaced by Florestan for the Finale, an outpouring of thematic exuberance that grows from a fugue-like opening (and incorporates an episode recalling the Andante’s magical coda). Though finished in November 1842, Schumann’s Piano Quartet did not receive its premiere until two years later, on December 8, 1844, in Leipzig, when it proved successful with the audience. The performance was entrusted to a distinguished group of players: in addition to the cellist Wielhorsky, the ensemble consisted of three accomplished performer-composers—violinist Ferdinand David (who would premiere Mendelssohn’s E-minor Violin Concerto the following year), violist Niels Gade, and Clara Schumann interpreting her husband’s piano part in this work she described as “youthful and fresh.”</p><p><strong>—James M.
