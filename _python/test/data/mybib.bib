TITLE = {Innovative Dual-Stage Blind Noise Reduction in Real-World Images Using Multi-Scale Convolutions and Dual Attention Mechanisms},
JOURNAL = {Symmetry},
VOLUME = {15},
YEAR = {2023},
NUMBER = {11},

ABSTRACT = {The distribution of real noise in images can disrupt the inherent symmetry present in many natural visuals, thus making its effective removal a paramount challenge. However, traditional denoising methods often require tedious manual parameter tuning, and a significant portion of deep learning-driven techniques have proven inadequate for real noise. Moreover, the efficiency of end-to-end algorithms in restoring symmetrical patterns in noisy images remains questionable. To harness the principles of symmetry for improved denoising, we introduce a dual deep learning model with a focus on preserving and leveraging symmetrical patterns in real images. Our methodology operates in two stages. In the first, we estimate the noise level using a four-layer neural network, thereby aiming to capture the underlying symmetrical structures of the original image. To enhance the extraction of symmetrical features and overall network performance, a dual attention mechanism is employed before the final convolutional layer. This innovative module adaptively assigns weights to features across different channels, thus emphasizing symmetry-preserving elements. The subsequent phase is devoted to non-blind denoising. It integrates the estimated noise level and the original image, thus targeting the challenge of denoising while preserving symmetrical patterns. Here, a multi-scale architecture is used, thereby amalgamating image features into two branches. The first branch taps into dilation convolution, thus amplifying the receptive field without introducing new parameters and making it particularly adept at capturing broad symmetrical structures. In contrast, the second branch employs a standard convolutional layer to focus on finer symmetrical details. By harnessing varied receptive fields, our method can recognize and restore image symmetries across different scales. Crucial skip connections are embedded within this multi-scale setup, thus ensuring that symmetrical image data is retained as the network deepens. Experimental evaluations, conducted on four benchmark training sets and 12 test datasets, juxtaposed with over 20 contemporary models based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics, underscore our model’s prowess in not only denoising but also in preserving and accentuating symmetrical elements, thereby setting a new gold standard in the field.},

  abstract = {In this work the author, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his seminal work in psychology that challenged the rational model of judgment and decision making, has brought together his many years of research and thinking in one book. He explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. He exposes the extraordinary capabilities, and also the faults and biases, of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. He reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives, and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. This author's work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this book, he takes us on a tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and the way we make choices.},

abstract={High-performance mainframe computers are commonly implemented using bipolar VLSI technologies. The simulation of such circuits is very time-consuming using traditional direct methods, as in SPICE. Relaxation-based methods such as waveform relaxation (WR) have been used to speed up the simulation of MOS circuits, but they have not been as effective for bipolar circuits because of the strong coupling between logic gates. In this paper, a fast, robust overlapped waveform relaxation (OWR) algorithm is presented. OWR is effective for bipolar circuits because it uses an overlapped partitioning strategy to overcome the effect of strong coupling on convergence speed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm, simulation results are presented for combinational and sequential digital bipolar circuits as well as analog bipolar circuits. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the speed advantage of OWR compared to the direct method increases with circuit size. The OWR algorithm is more robust than standard WR; it converges in cases where WR diverges or converges too slowly. OWR is about two times faster than WR for tightly coupled bipolar circuits},

Besides the mixed signal nature of the designs, the analog sections also include continuous-time and discrete-time components. Thus, for analysis of these integrated modules, all encompassing simulation capabilities are required that address, not only transient analysis of mixed analog-digital circuits, but frequency domain analysis as well. In this paper, we present mechanisms for multilevel and mixed-domain simulation of analog systems tied in with mixed analog-digital simulation. We then describe the implementation in the form of an open-ended and expandable simulation framework, iMACSIM.

abstract={This paper presents new, highly-efficient techniques for simulating extremely large circuits, assuming that hierarchical design techniques have been used. Both hierarchical and partitioned circuits consist of a master circuit and several sub-circuits. Hierarchical circuits permit sub-circuits to be reused, while partitioned circuits permit only a single use of each sub-circuit. Both types of circuits permit multiple levels of hierarchy. In partitioned circuits, triggering is used to perform simulations that are several times faster than Levelized Compiled Code (LCC) simulation. For hierarchical simulation, the concept of boundary activity is introduced. Optimization with respect to boundary activity can produce simulations that are much faster than ordinary flat simulations. It is further shown that hierarchical design can permit the efficient simulation of circuits that cannot be simulated on a single workstation using ordinary flat simulation. Aggressive use of hierarchy is used to demonstrate the simulation of circuits containing as many as four billion (4,000,000,000) gates},

abstract={The capability of time domain simulation with frequency domain data exists in some time-domain simulators, but the computations can be time-consuming. We decrease this computational burden by exploiting S-parameter fitter and fast recursive convolution methods. With recursive convolution the frequencies at which the S-parameters are sampled may be spaced in any way. For example, a logarithmic frequency spacing allows S-parameters to be sampled over a broader band without increasing the number of frequencies measured. We use two different system identification techniques for extracting the closed-form equations describing measured or simulated S-parameter data. Lumped parameter systems are approximated as a rational polynomial modulated by a complex exponential. Distributed parameter systems are approximated by the sum of complex exponentials. The recursive convolution engine handles both forms. The HP SPICE circuit simulator has been extended to allow fast, recursive convolution methods to be employed for transient analysis. The resulting simulator is called SSpice v2. Significant speed-up in the simulation of several circuits have been achieved using this new technique compared to both the traditional approach in SPICE and our previous direct-convolution-based approach in SSpice v1. In this paper, we present the algorithms and applications of the simulator. Three applications are demonstrated in the paper which are MR head flex line modeling, chip-to-chip signal modeling on MCM, and on-chip inductor modeling},

The macromodel can be incorporated directly into a conventional circuit simulation with no modification of the original simulation software. The techniques are suitable for development as a software library that can be used to enhance existing simulators so that they can handle large VLSI interconnect configurations very efficiently.

abstract={Simulation is still one of the most important subtasks when designing a VLSI circuit. However more and more elements on a chip increase simulation runtimes. Especially on transistor level with highly accurate element modelling, long simulation runtimes of typically several hours delay the design process. One possibility to reduce these runtimes is to divide the circuit into several partitions and to simulate the partitions in parallel. But the success of such a parallel simulation is heavily dependent on the quality of the partitioning. This paper presents a new approach for partitioning VLSI circuits on transistor level and gives runtimes of parallel simulations of large industrial circuits. The resulting runtimes show considerable improvement compared to a known partitioning method, the node tearing method},

abstract={A variable-band relaxation algorithm for solving large linear systems is developed as an alternative to Gauss-Jacobi relaxation. This algorithm seeks to improve the reliability of Gauss-Jacobi relaxation by extracting a variable-sized band from the matrix and solving that band directly. This leads to a relaxation algorithm with provably better convergence properties. The algorithm can be used effectively on a massively parallel computer because band matrices can be solved in log( n) time on n/2 processors. Test results are presented which compare the convergence properties of variable-band and Gauss-Jacobi relaxation},

It is possible to reduce the simulation time without compromising accuracy by exploiting the fact that the behavior of such a circuit in a given high-frequency clock cycle is similar, but not identical, to its behavior in the preceding and following cycles. In particular, the envelope of the high-frequency clock can be followed by accurately computing the circuit behavior over occasional cycles. The authors describe the implementation of an envelope-following method that is particularly efficient for switching power and filter circuits, and they present results demonstrating the method's effectiveness},

abstract={This paper presents a parameterized reduction technique for highly nonlinear systems. In our approach, we first approximate the nonlinear system with a convex combination of parameterized linear models created by linearizing the nonlinear system at points along training trajectories. Each of these linear models is then projected using a moment-matching scheme into a low-order subspace, resulting in a parameterized reduced-order nonlinear system. Several options for selecting the linear models and constructing the projection matrix are presented and analyzed. In addition, we propose a training scheme which automatically selects parameter-space training points by approximating parameter sensitivities. Results and comparisons are presented for three examples which contain distributed strong nonlinearities: a diode transmission line, a microelectromechanical switch, and a pulse-narrowing nonlinear transmission line. In most cases, we are able to accurately capture the parameter dependence over the parameter ranges of plusmn50% from the nominal values and to achieve an average simulation speedup of about 10x.},

abstract={Because of the high cost of fabricating an Integrated Circuit(IC), it is important to verify the design using simulation. There are a wide variety of techniques for simulating integrated circuit designs, but the most accurate is to construct the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe a given circuit, and solve the system with a numerical integration method. This approach, referred to as circuit simulation, is computationally expensive, particularly when applied to large circuits. To reduce the computation time required to simulate large MOS circuits, new numerical integration algorithms based on relaxation techniques have been developed. These techniques can reduce the simulation time as much as an order of magnitudes over standard circuit simulation programs. In addilion, they are particularly suited for parallel implementation. In this paper we will focus on the Waveform Relaxation (WR) family of algorithms. Algorithms in this family will be reviewed, convergence theorems will be offered, and their implementation on a parallel processor presented.},

We show that the proposed hierarchical preconditioning scheme not only brings significant runtime speedup over the conventional block diagonal (BD) preconditioner for driven circuits, but also enhances the simulation of autonomous circuits. Due to the specific algorithm construction, this hierarchical preconditioning can be achieved by solving a set of linear matrix problems with tree-like data dependency. Hence, it can be naturally parallelized to further improve the simulation efficiency. An efficient parallel HB simulation engine has been developed by distributing the simulation workload over a cluster of machines via message passing interface (MPI). Our experiments have shown that this new parallel HB algorithm can achieve the significant runtime speedup over the conventional serial preconditioning technique.},

abstract={As a widely adopted frequency-domain method, harmonic balance (HB) provides efficient steady-state circuit analysis for analog and RF circuits. The conventional matrix-implicit Krylov subspace technique with the block-diagonal (BD) preconditioner has made it possible to compute the steady-state responses of large-scale circuits. However, not all HB problems, particularly strongly nonlinear circuit problems, can be solved reliably or efficiently using the standard BD-preconditioning technique. In this paper, hierarchical HB methods are proposed wherein robust preconditioning is provided via solution of a set of approximate linearized HB problems of progressively smaller size across multiple levels of the problem hierarchy. These subproblems are constructed using the same matrix-implicit formulation to retain the memory efficiency of Krylov subspace methods. Moreover, the number of allocated Krylov subspace matrix solvers, hence the memory usage, is significantly reduced via a recently introduced solver-sharing technique. The efficiency of our hierarchical preconditioning technique is further improved by adopting a one-step correction to the standard BD preconditioner and a multigrid-motivated iterative scheme. It has been shown that the proposed approaches can achieve up to 10 runtime speedup over the popular BD preconditioner and robust convergence even for strongly nonlinear circuits for which the BD preconditioner fails to converge.},

abstract={Designers of RF circuits such as power amplifiers, mixers, and filters make extensive use of simulation tools which perform periodic steady-state analysis and its extensions, but until the mid 1990s, the computational costs of these simulation tools restricted designers from simulating the behavior of complete RF subsystems. The introduction of fast matrix-implicit iterative algorithms completely changed this situation, and extensions of these fast methods are providing tools which can perform periodic, quasi-periodic, and periodic noise analysis of circuits with thousands of devices. Even though there are a number of research groups continuing to develop extensions of matrix-implicit methods, there is still no compact characterization which introduces the novice researcher to the fundamental issues. In this paper, we examine the basic periodic steady-state problem and provide both examples and linear algebra abstractions to demonstrate connections between seemingly dissimilar methods and to try to provide a more general framework for fast methods than the standard time-versus-frequency domain characterization of finite-difference, basis-collocation, and shooting methods},

In recent years, a number of statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) and statistical circuit optimization techniques have emerged to quickly estimate the design yield and perform robust optimization. These statistical methods often rely on the availability of statistical process variation models whose accuracy, however, is severely hampered by the limitations in test structure design, test time, and various sources of inaccuracy inevitably incurred in process characterization. To consider model characterization inaccuracy, we present an efficient importance sampling based optimization framework that can translate the uncertainty in process models to the uncertainty in circuit performance, thus offering the desired statistical best/worst case circuit analysis capability accounting for the unavoidable complexity in process characterization. Furthermore, our new technique provides valuable guidance to process characterization. Examples are included to demonstrate the application of our general analysis framework under the context of SSTA.},

abstract={ A compact nonlinear model order-reduction method (NORM) is presented that is applicable for time-invariant and periodically time-varying weakly nonlinear systems. NORM is suitable for model order reduction of a class of weakly nonlinear systems that can be well characterized by low-order Volterra functional series. The automatically extracted macromodels capture not only the first-order (linear) system properties, but also the important second-order effects of interest that cannot be neglected for a broad range of applications. Unlike the existing projection-based reduction methods for weakly nonlinear systems, NORM begins with the general matrix-form Volterra nonlinear transfer functions to derive a set of minimum Krylov subspaces for order reduction. Moment matching of the nonlinear transfer functions by projection of the original system onto this set of minimum Krylov subspaces leads to a significant reduction of model size. As we will demonstrate as part of comparison with existing methods, the efficacy of model reduction for weakly nonlinear systems is determined by the achievable model compactness. Our results further indicate that a multipoint version of NORM can substantially improve the model compactness for nonlinear system reduction. Furthermore, we show that the structure of the nonlinear system can be exploited to simplify the reduced model in practice, which is particularly effective for circuits with sharp frequency selectivity. We demonstrate the practical utility of NORM and its extension for macromodeling weakly nonlinear RF communication circuits with periodically time-varying behavior.},

Stable explicit numerical integration is achieved by adopting an explicit inner integrator (e.g. forward Euler) in a multi-level telescopic projective framework, thereby addressing the well-known stability limitation of many explicit numerical integration methods. In the presented approach, the effective time step of the entire multi-level integration is no longer limited by the smallest time constant of the circuit so as to safeguard stability. Rather, it is controlled solely by the accuracy requirement. This makes it possible to explore the natural parallelizability of such explicit integration method for parallel circuit simulation. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach and its parallel implementation on multi-core machines with encouraging initial results.},

abstract={Large VLSI on-chip power distribution networks (PDN) are challenging to analyze due to the sheer network complexity. In this paper, a novel parallel partitioning based PDN analysis approach is presented. We use the boundary circuit responses of each partition to divide the full grid simulation problem into a set of independent sub grid simulation problems. Instead of solving exact boundary circuit responses, a more efficient scheme to provide near exact approximation to the boundary circuit responses by exploiting the spatial locality of the flip-chip type power grids is proposed, in which only several small sub power grids need to be solved. This scheme is also used in a block based iterative error reduction process to improve the convergence. Through the analysis of several large power grids, the proposed approach, which can be fully parallelizable, is shown to have great runtime efficiency, fast convergence, and favorable scalability. Our approach can solve a 7.2 million-node power grid in 26 seconds, which is 18 times faster than a state of the art direct solver.},

abstract={Clock meshes posses inherent low clock skews and excellent immunity to PVT variations, and have increasingly found their way to high-performance IC designs. However, analysis of such massively coupled networks is significantly hindered by the sheer size of the network and tight coupling between non-tree interconnects and large numbers of clock drivers. The presented Harmonic-weighted model order reduction algorithm is motivated by the key observation of the steady-state operation of the clock networks, and its efficiency is facilitated by the locality analysis via port sliding. The scalability of the analysis is significantly improved by eliminating the need of computing infeasible multi-port passive reduced order interconnect models with large port count. And the overall task is decomposed into tractable and naturally parallelizable model generation and FFT/Inverse-FFT operations, all on a per driver or per sink basis.},

abstract={Model order reduction has been a driving force for reducing analysis complexity of VLSI systems containing large linear networks. However, most existing reduction techniques are only applicable to networks with a small number of ports, failing to fulfill an even stronger need of reducing massively interconnected subsystems such as power grids and wide buses. In this paper, a port packing scheme is presented wherein the correlation between circuit ports is explored in a frequency-dependent manner. In the proposed McPack (multiport circuit packing) algorithm, port packing is combined with a practical realization of the recently developed tangential interpolation scheme for model reduction. McPack performs feasible moment matching for networks with many ports in the sense of tangential interpolation. With guaranteed passivity, extensibility to multi-point expansion as well as comparable complexity, McPack systematically introduces frequency-domain port packing into the existing projection-based model order reduction framework. For several large networks with high port count, the presented algorithm is shown to be significantly more accurate than the standard block-moment matching algorithm as well as other recently developed alternative},

abstract={In this paper, an efficient approach is proposed for the problem of transient simulation of lossy transmission lines. The complexity of the conventional convolution approach for lossy transmission lines is reduced from O(N2) to O(Nlog2N) by utilizing a multilevel FFT convolution method, where N is the total number of time points. Numerical convolution formula that exploits both the analytical forms of the lossy transmission line impulse responses and adaptive time steps are developed for the multilevel FFT convolution method. A new breakpoint control scheme is also proposed to adaptively control simulation time step. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is over 100 times faster than Berkeley SPICE3 (Quarles, et al, 1993) while remains the same accuracy.},
