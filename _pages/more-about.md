If you have reached this page,
you are chosen ones :) because
this page cannot be reached by (any sequence of) links from my homepage;
a separate URL should have been given to you by me.

This page depicts what kind of business and social activities
I am executing or leading
and how they are connected to
the multiple roles that I am taking
and most importantly
to the future I am designing.
So in a sense this page complements my [About page](/about/),
but in another sense, shows a totally different picture.

While my multiple concurrent roles
(Co-founder &amp; CTO
@ <a href="https://sungheeyun-erudio.github.io/">Erudio Bio, Inc., CA, USA</a>,
Chief Business Development Officer (CBDO)
@ <a href="https://westory.ai/">WeStory.ai, CA, USA</a>,

<a href="https://www.dgist.ac.kr/prog/peopleProfsr/en_eecs/sub02_01/list.do">an Advisory Professor</a>
of <a href="https://www.dgist.ac.kr/en_eecs/">Department of Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (EECS)</a>

and
Network Expert Consultant
@ <a href="https://glginsights.com/">Gerson Lehrman Group, Inc.</a>)
may appear scattered across too many domains, they're all interconnected threads of the same intellectual fabric.

In 2024, Nobel Prize Committee awarded Nobel prize in chemistry to a non-chemist;
Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google Deep Mind.
This is mainly due to the release of AlphaFold 3 which claims to be able to predict
(accurately) the 3D folding of virtually every protein that could exist in the world.
While Nobel prizes are generally awarded to <i>old</i> people
because they do it for the contributions they or their work has made
for humanities,
which can only be observed for a long period of time,
this prize were immediate (in a sense)
implying that the Nobel Committee could not help but
recognize the enormous potential of this technology.

Here we observed two aspects of AI.
First, its utmost versatility!
The very algorithm which once played Go at the world champion-level
now has been tailored and tuned (so to speak)
to predict 3D foldings of proteins.
Second,
AI, at least with the current deep neural network (DNN) architecture,
needs lots and lots of data.
AlphaGo needed thousands of years of Go play history made in China, Japan, and Korea,
to jump-start (so to speak).
AlphaFold needed the output of
tens of years of hard work of many biochemists
to jump-start.

Here we see that every AI algorithm (again as long as its core learning mechanism depends heavily on DNN)
needs lots and lots of data.
Not just lots of data, but <i>quality</i> data.
This is where the Erudio Bio's AI Vision comes in.
We are <i>not</i> just developing multiplexing biomarker detection and screening technology.
We are developing <font class="emph">AI-powered multiplexing biomarker data platform for Agentic AI</font>
to deliver differentiated values to our customers
with quality bulk bio data.

So Erudio Bio can potentially do or help do knowledge discovery using AI,
<i>e.g.</i>,
predict the probability of getting certain cancer in 5 years,
or
estimate the re-hospitalization chance
to use for the decision of patient discharges at the hospitals.
Or Erudio Bio can do bio data business;
Mayo Clinic has done this type of business now for more than 2 years already,
which means
they have figured out how to deal with all (privacy-related) ,
hence the real market is already there!

Now as soon as we talk about bio or medical data,
we've engaged with data privacy issues.
(Another good example is high-tech industry data, such as,
the data coming out of advanced semiconductor fabs.)
Hence, my role as Advisor and Evangelist @ CryptoLab,
for which I essentially do business development for US market,
is not a coincidence, but inevitability
because CryptoLab delivers customers essential tool kits for
private AI,
that is, the capability for training AI models
using privacy-sensitive bio/medical/industry data
without compromising security/confidentiality/privacy.
And, hence did I found [the new Silicon Valley Private AI Forum, K-PAI](https://k-privateai.github.io/)!

So to me, (the businesses of) the companies or forums that I either own or help for business development
are all connected.

{% assign ai_data = site.posts | where: "permalink", "/ai/data" | first %}

Now let us zoom out a bit. As I explain in [{{ ai_data.title }}]({{ ai_data.url }}),
now has come <font class="emph">the age of Agentic AI</font>,
and in [the column]({{ ai_data.url }}) (<i>i.e.</i>, [the post]({{ ai_data.url }})),
I said the importance of the domain expertise together with the capability of
maximally leveraging the power of AI Agents has become
culminated.
Hence did I join [WeStory.ai](https://westory.ai/).

I think AI is not yet another technology that human race has ever invented
or technological events that human race has to go through,
such as,
Industrial Revolution, Internet, and Mobile.
It shares common properties or traits,
for example,
the impact radius is huge.
However, not only is the impact radius huge,
but
the dynamics and nature of the impacts and changes
are unprecedented.
(I will write a column or blog post about this soon.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>).
For this, I also explore and strive to find opportunities
to contribute to humanity
using my differentiated insight and technological knowledge
from my industry-long experience in AI and
fundamental understanding in
the nature of AI (algorithms)
based on strong background in math and theory
as well as capability of deep philosophical and spiritual thinking.

For this, I joined [Salzburg Global Seminar](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/),
the 78 year old non-profit organization,
as [KFAS-Salzburg Global Leadership Initiative Fellow](https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/latest-news/article/introducing-the-second-cohort-of-the-kfas-salzburg-global-leadership-initiative).

Now here I will list some web pages or columns or blog posts relevant or related to what I mentioned above
that I maintain or wrote!
